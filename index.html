            This provided map is without the names of streets, historical landmarks, restaurants, or any other icons we often associate with the map of today. Instead what's offered is a different perspective of New York City.
        
            <br><br>

            With each marker selected, witness how intimately and, for the most part, effortlessly death weaves its way into the urban fabric of our city. Users are encouraged to drift from marker to marker and observe not only the architecture of the funeral homes themselves, but also the surrounding area. There's neither a beginning nor an end in navigating this map, so take as little or as much time in exploring an aspect of the city that is often walked by unnoticed. 

            <br><br>

            What's represented is merely a small fraction of the funeral homes scattered throughout this metropolis.
